# Intro
GWPAN features frontend live-time number formatting and since it's heavy JS powered now, we also add webpack to build CSS and JS.

# Instructions
Download the release ZIP or you can switch to this branch and run `npm install`, `npm run build:dev` and `npm run build` to get production CSS & JS compiled. Use `npm run whatch` while developing.
